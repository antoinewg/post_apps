This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Database management

Make sure to have `.env` file configured correctly. Do not commit though.
 
When adding a new table, or column, execute the SQL statement [locally](http://localhost:54323/), or by adding it manually.

Then generate the migration with `pnpx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`. This will add a file `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<migration_name>/migration.sql`.

Optionaly, you can modify the `prisma/seed.ts` for when you reset the db locally.

You can then commit and push the local migrations with `pnpx prisma db push`.

Don't forget to re-generate the types: `pnpx prisma generate`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
